Description:
    The 'trainjs new' command creates a new Train application with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

Example:
    trainjs new ~/trainjs_project/myapp

    This generates a skeletal Train installation in ~/trainjs_project/myapp.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
